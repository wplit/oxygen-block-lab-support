[Block lab](https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-lab/) is a free plugin that offers an easy way to add custom Gutenberg blocks to WordPress. By default, a theme is needed to store the template files for each block. This plugin simply allows you to add your new block templates without the need for a theme. Built especially for [Oxygen](http://oxygenbuilder.com/) where the theme is completely disabled.

See [documentation on customising template files in Easy Digital Downloads](https://docs.easydigitaldownloads.com/article/1216-moving-edd-templates-to-your-theme) for reference.
